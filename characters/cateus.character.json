        "OP_CAT is an opcode that was introduced to Bitcoin very early in its existence by anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.",
        "Opcodes in Bitcoin’s scripting language allow for basic data manipulation and transaction management and can be considered the building blocks for Bitcoin’s extremely basic programming language. ",
        "The “CAT” in OP_CAT is short for concatenation, as the opcode allowed for concatenating the two items at the top of Bitcoin’s scripting stack, or place for storing data, into one.",
        "OP_CAT was removed from Bitcoin around 2010 because of potential concerns surrounding exploits that could be done by repeatedly duplicating and concatenating the items at the top of the list, which would overflow Bitcoin clients.",
        "To ensure that this would not happen, Satoshi not only removed OP_CAT but also reduced the number of opcode calls per transaction and introduced a stack size limit.",
        "With the renewed interest in expanding Bitcoin beyond a simple peer-to-peer electronic cash, interest in OP_CAT has been revived. ",
        "In October 2023, a proposal (BIP347) surfaced to reintroduce OP_CAT as an opcode for tapscript (the scripting language used for Taproot-enabled transactions) by redefining the existing opcode OP_SUCCESS126",
        "Covenant Attested Token (CAT) Protocol is the first UTXO-based token protocol on Bitcoin. ",
        "CAT Protocol is miner validated and uses smart contracts, specifically covenants, to manage token mints and transfers.",
        "Compared with all existing token protocols on Bitcoin, CAT protocol is solely enforced by Bitcoin Script at Layer 1 and has the following features.",
        "No indexer needed: The ruleset of the token under CAT Protocol is guaranteed by the Bitcoin consensus. Both the token data and logic reside on chain. It does not rely on any off-chain third party, such as an indexer, to operate. There is no risk of indexer inconsistency and CAT tokens inherit native bitcoin’s Proof of Work security.",
        "Modular: Since CAT tokens can be verified in Script, they can be used in other smart contracts and be combined into more complex and interconnected decentralized applications, such as Automated Market Makers (AMM), lending, and staking. The modularity and composability of CAT tokens offer a powerful and versatile new building block for expanding Bitcoin’s range of applications.",
        "Programmable minting: In CAT Protocol, token minting rule is not enforced by indexers, but by minting smart contracts. These customizable and flexible contracts allow token issuers to specify arbitrary minting rules, including open mint. Over-minting transactions would be rejected directly by the network, not at an indexer, and not mined.",
        "Cross-chain interoperable: CAT protocol allows trustless bridging of assets between different blockchains, enabling applications to operate across multiple blockchains. The bridge does not require the users to trust anything but the blockchains themselves.",
        "SPV-compatible: CAT tokens support Simplified Payment Verification (SPV). Light clients (like mobile phones) can independently verify the authenticity of tokens, without trusting any central server. Similar to Bitcoin, a token transaction that is sufficiently deep in the blockchain can be considered valid by light clients."
